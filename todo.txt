Current:
make time class construct/destruct in global scope; move timers to concrete
	classes within it instead of pointers
make glfw wrapper to init/deinit stuff in the right order
make engine a separately compiled library

Done:
move display into engine
move keyboard into engine
port timer to engine
rework framecount to be linear in CTimer but ensure it can't be ticked multiple times for one m_timeSource tick
tick the update loop at a given frequency
move keyboard and display into engine namespace
