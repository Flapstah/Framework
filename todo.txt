Current:
why is the tick being called too often?  Maybe need something other than a
simple frame count to compare during tick?  Maybe just store the parent timer
time?
add function to get hours/minutes/seconds to timesource
make glfw wrapper to init/deinit stuff in the right order
make engine a separately compiled library

Done:
need to do some tests to make sure timing is working (renderer seems to show
		about 0.6 seconds elapsed per real second passed) - don't use game clock for
		real time operations as frame lengths are capped!
remove platform_ functions where possible (e.g. RealTimeClock)
remove float versions of time and have tick return the time elapsed
make time class construct/destruct in global scope; move timers to concrete
	classes within it instead of pointers
move display into engine
move keyboard into engine
port timer to engine
rework framecount to be linear in CTimer but ensure it can't be ticked multiple times for one m_timeSource tick
tick the update loop at a given frequency
move keyboard and display into engine namespace
