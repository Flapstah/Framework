Current:
make glfw wrapper to init/deinit stuff in the right order
make engine a separately compiled library

Done:
remove platform_ functions where possible (e.g. RealTimeClock)
remove float versions of time and have tick return the time elapsed
make time class construct/destruct in global scope; move timers to concrete
	classes within it instead of pointers
move display into engine
move keyboard into engine
port timer to engine
rework framecount to be linear in CTimer but ensure it can't be ticked multiple times for one m_timeSource tick
tick the update loop at a given frequency
move keyboard and display into engine namespace
